# Toast Notifications Library

## Overview
A modern, feature-rich toast notification library for React/TypeScript applications. This project provides a comprehensive toast solution that can be distributed via npm and CDN, featuring multiple variants, flexible positioning, promise-based API, and beautiful animations.

## Project Structure

The core toast notification library that will be published to npm and CDN.

**Features:**
- Multiple toast variants (success, error, warning, info, loading)
- 6 positioning options (top-left, top-center, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-center, bottom-right)
- Promise-based API for async operations
- Customizable duration and auto-dismiss
- Smooth slide and fade animations
- Stack management for multiple toasts
- Full TypeScript support
- Rich customization (custom icons, className, style overrides)

### Demo Website (`/client`)
Interactive demo website showcasing all library features with comprehensive documentation.

**Sections:**
- Hero with live interactive toast demo
- Features grid highlighting capabilities
- Installation instructions (npm & CDN)
- Code examples with syntax highlighting
- API reference documentation
- Footer with links

- ✅ **Smooth animations** (enter/exit) for all dismissal methods
- ✅ **Stack management** with proper spacing and collision avoidance
- ✅ **Auto-dismiss** with configurable duration
- ✅ **Manual dismiss** with X button
- ✅ **Build configuration** (package.json with exports, TypeScript declarations)
- ✅ **Integration and testing** - All features verified working

### Ready for Publishing
- 📦 npm package configuration complete (lib/toast/package.json)
- 📦 TypeScript declarations (.d.ts) configured
- 📦 Demo website ready for deployment

## API Design

```typescript
// Basic usage
toast.success('Success message!');
toast.error('Error message');
toast.warning('Warning message');
toast.info('Info message');
toast.loading('Loading...');

// Promise API
toast.promise(myPromise, {
  loading: 'Loading...',
  success: 'Done!',
  error: 'Failed',
});

// Custom options
toast.success('Custom toast', {
  duration: 5000,
  position: 'top-center',
  icon: '🎉',
  className: 'custom-class',
});

// Dismiss toasts
toast.dismiss(); // Dismiss all
toast.dismiss(toastId); // Dismiss specific
```

## Installation (Future)

### Via npm
```bash
npm install @your-org/toast-notifications
```

### Via CDN
```javascript
import { toast } from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@your-org/toast-notifications/dist/index.esm.js';
```

  - Added inline styles for explicit positioning to ensure viewport-relative placement
  - Fixed bottom positions to use `flex-col-reverse` for proper upward stacking
  - Verified all 6 positions work correctly with e2e tests
- 2024-11-07: **Project complete and ready for publishing**

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Animation System
- **Enter animation**: 200ms slide + fade with smooth easing
- **Exit animation**: 150ms slide + fade, triggered by `isExiting: true` state
- **Critical fix**: Dismissal flow marks toast as exiting, waits for animation, then removes from state
- All dismissal methods use same animation system (auto-dismiss, manual, promise transitions)

### State Management
- Toast manager uses singleton pattern with subscriber notifications
- **Critical fix**: Must clone arrays AND objects when notifying subscribers to ensure React re-renders
- Each toast has unique ID, variant, message, options, and isExiting state

### Positioning Architecture
- **Portal Rendering**: Toast containers rendered via React `createPortal` directly into `document.body` to ensure fixed positioning works correctly
- **Inline Styles**: Explicit CSS positioning (top/bottom/left/right) via inline styles ensures positioning works regardless of Tailwind
- Separate containers rendered for each position with active toasts
- Toasts grouped by their `position` option
- **Top positions**: Use `flex-col` - new toasts appear below existing ones (stack grows downward)
- **Bottom positions**: Use `flex-col-reverse` - toasts stack from bottom upward (visually grow upward)
- Center positions use flexbox centering, side positions use fixed offsets
- Stack management with consistent 8px gap between toasts

## User Preferences
- Professional, polished visual design
- Feature parity with popular toast libraries (react-hot-toast, sonner)
- Distribution via both npm and CDN
- TypeScript-first approach
